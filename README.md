## What?

This repository demonstrates how OIDC can be set up and used from GitHub Actions. It's also meant to be a demonstration of what OIDC is.

## Why?

I've been intrigued by OIDC from the moment I heard about it and wanted to let the world know its awesomeness too.

## How?

This repo is standalone, being an OIDC provider and a client. I'll mark appropriately in the Actions workflow, which steps are the provider and which steps are the clients.
